place files in qpid-proton/examples/python

you may need to setup the python environment by running "source config.sh" from the qpid-proton/build directory

openshift origin should be running with enmasse and the oc command should be in the path

to start a receiver:
    oc_freceive [address]

to start a sender:
    oc_rsend [address]

if you don't pass an address, "anycast" will be used

random_send.py is a hack of simple_send.py that sends a random number of messages to an address and then waits a random number of seconds.

oc_rsend will call random_send.py with the host/address for the messaging service

forever_recv.py is a hack of simple_recv that will stay connected and listening well, forever

oc_freceive will call forever_recv.py with the host/address for the messaging service
